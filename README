**These are my scripts that I use to do things.**

* ubuntu.sh - This script is used to bring up a docker image of ubuntu. ubuntu:latest is the image name and all this does is it opens an ubuntu shell in terminal which contains my pwd in a test folder.

* valgrind.sh - This uses the same docker image as above which has valgrind on it.
